# FHIR connector

FHIR connector for connecting with the FHIR APIs. 


## Setup

Install and setup the Java RCS: https://backstage.forgerock.com/docs/openicf/latest/connector-reference/java-server.html

Once Java RCS openicf is downloaded, create a tools directory in the openicf directory. Place these groovy scripts in this tools directory.

There are also 3 libraries that need to be installed. These are called secrets-api, chf-http-core, and json-web-token. These can be installed in the /lib/framework directory of openicf.

## Configurations

Using the Platform UI, go to applications and browse app catalog. Select the Scripted Rest Connector.  

After creating the connector, set these configurations:
